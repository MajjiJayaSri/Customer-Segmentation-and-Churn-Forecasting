## Overview

This project is structured in two main phases:

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Applying clustering (e.g. K‚ÄëMeans, hierarchical clustering) on feature-engineered customer data to group users based on behavior, value, or engagement.
2. **Churn Forecasting**: Using classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict churn probability‚Äîespecially focusing on high-risk clusters.

---

## Data

- **Source datasets**: (describe if synthetic or sourced‚Äîe.g., telecom, banking, or retail data)
- **Key features**: Demographics, usage metrics, tenure, billing history, customer service interactions, engagement frequency.
- Data cleaning, encoding, scaling, imbalance handling (e.g. SMOTE) applied during preprocessing.

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Removal of missing values or outliers  
- Encoding categorical features using one-hot or label encoding  
- Data scaling (e.g. MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler)  

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Determining optimal cluster count (e.g. elbow method, silhouette score)  
- Clustering technique(s) used  
- Cluster profiling to interpret segment characteristics

### 3. Churn Modeling
- Handling class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE  
- Model training using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
